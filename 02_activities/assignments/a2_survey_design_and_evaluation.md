# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:
The Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (Cycle 33), conducted by Statistics Canada, offers comprehensive insights into Canadians' contributory behaviors. Below is an overview of its key features:

Sample Type:
The survey employed a sample survey with a cross-sectional design, utilizing a stratified sampling method to ensure representation across various demographics. 
WWW23.STATCAN.GC.CA

Sample Size:
The 2018 GSS collected data from 16,149 respondents aged 15 and over. 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

Target Population:
Individuals aged 15 years and older residing in private households across Canada's 10 provinces. The survey excluded full-time residents of institutions. 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame combined landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address. 
WWW23.STATCAN.GC.CA

Survey Mode(s):
Data were collected through electronic questionnaires and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Respondents could choose between English and French. 
WWW23.STATCAN.GC.CA

Timeline:
Data collection occurred from September 4, 2018, to December 28, 2018. 
WWW23.STATCAN.GC.CA

Response Rate:
Specific response rates for the 2018 cycle are not detailed in the provided sources.

Weights:
To ensure representativeness, survey data were weighted. Weights were calculated to account for the probability of selection and to adjust for non-response, aligning the sample with the broader Canadian population. 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

Data Processing:
Data underwent rigorous processing, including validation checks and editing, to ensure accuracy and consistency. This process involved verifying responses and rectifying inconsistencies. 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

Cleaning, Imputation, etc.:
While specific imputation methods for missing data are not detailed in the provided sources, standard practices likely involved techniques to handle non-responses and ensure data completeness.

Sources of Error:
Potential sources of error include sampling error, non-sampling error (such as measurement errors or data processing mistakes), and non-response bias. Efforts were made to minimize these through careful survey design and implementation. 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

Limitations, Known Biases, etc.:
The 2018 GSS introduced an Internet response option for the first time, which may affect comparability with previous cycles. Changes in survey methodology, such as the introduction of an electronic questionnaire, may have impacted estimates, making direct comparisons with previous iterations inappropriate. 
WWW23.STATCAN.GC.CA

Link to Documentation and Additional Sources:
Comprehensive documentation, including the Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) and User Guide, is available at: 
WWW150.STATCAN.GC.CA

Additional information about the survey can be found at:
